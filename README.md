# Dynamic Pricing Strategy

## 

Dynamic Pricing Strategy is a data-driven approach that adjusts the prices of products or services in real-time based on various factors. By employing data science techniques, businesses can optimize revenue and profitability through flexible pricing that responds to market demand, customer behavior, demographics, and competitor prices.

## Project Description

This project implements a dynamic pricing strategy, specifically for a ride-sharing service, using data obtained from Uber's rides list (file.csv). The objective is to maximize revenue by adjusting ride costs based on demand and supply levels observed in the data. 

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Price Adjustment**: Dynamically modifies ride prices in response to real-time demand and supply factors.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizes historical sales data, customer purchase patterns, and market demand forecasts to inform pricing decisions.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Employs machine learning algorithms to analyze data and optimize pricing strategies based on various conditions.
- **Demand and Supply Analysis**: Captures high-demand periods and low-supply scenarios to increase prices, while lowering prices during low-demand and high-supply situations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Dataset

The project utilizes a rides list obtained from Uber (list.csv) that includes data such as:
<br>
<br>
-**Historical Sales Data**
<br>
-**Customer Purchase Patterns**
<br>
-**Market Demand Forecasts**
<br>
-**Real-Time Market Data**
<br>
-**Customer Segmentation Data**
<br>
-**Cost Data**

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the rides list dataset and clean the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identify relevant features that impact pricing, such as ride duration, demand indicators, and time of day.
3. **Model Development**: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict optimal pricing.
4. **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm**: Create an algorithm that adjusts ride prices based on demand and supply levels.
5. **Visualization**: Plot graphs to visualize pricing changes and demand patterns over time.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreyansh055/dynamic-pricing-strategy.git
cd dynamic-pricing-strategy
Install Requirements:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
